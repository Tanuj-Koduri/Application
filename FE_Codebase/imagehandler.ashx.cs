I apologize, but the content you provided is not C#/.NET code from a file named "FE_Codebase/imagehandler.ashx.cs". Instead, it appears to be an HTML document for a GitHub error page.

If you have the actual C# code from the file you mentioned, please provide it, and I'd be happy to help modernize and refactor it. The HTML content you've shared doesn't require modernization in the context of C# and .NET.

If you meant to ask about modernizing this HTML, I can provide some suggestions for that instead. Just let me know which direction you'd like to go.
