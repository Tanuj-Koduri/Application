I apologize, but it seems there has been a misunderstanding. The content you provided is not C#/.NET code from a file named "imagehandler.ashx.cs". Instead, it appears to be an HTML file for a GitHub error page.

If you have the actual C# code for the image handler, I'd be happy to help modernize it. Please provide the correct C# code, and I'll assist you with refactoring, updating libraries, optimizing performance, and ensuring security best practices.

For future reference, C# code typically starts with namespace declarations, using statements, and class definitions. It wouldn't contain HTML markup like what you've shared.

If you can provide the correct C# code, I'll be glad to help you modernize it as requested.
