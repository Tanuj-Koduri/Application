I apologize, but the code you've provided is not C#/.NET code. It appears to be an HTML file, specifically an error page for a restricted access scenario on GitHub. 

Since there's no C#/.NET code to modernize or refactor, I can't provide the requested improvements. However, I can offer some general suggestions for modernizing HTML:

1. Use HTML5 semantic elements where appropriate (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
2. Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind for responsive design.
3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to enhance security.
4. Use modern CSS features like Flexbox or Grid for layout.
5. Ensure the page is accessible by adding appropriate ARIA attributes and following WCAG guidelines.
6. If you need interactivity, consider using modern JavaScript (ES6+) or a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.

If you have a specific C#/.NET file that you'd like modernized, please provide that code instead, and I'd be happy to help with refactoring and modernization.
