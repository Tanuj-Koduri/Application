I apologize, but the code you've provided is not C#/.NET code. It appears to be an HTML file, possibly an error page for GitHub. There's no C# code to modernize or refactor in this case.

If you have a specific C#/.NET file you'd like me to review and modernize, please provide that code instead. I'd be happy to help with refactoring C# code, updating libraries, optimizing performance, and ensuring security best practices.

For the HTML file you've shared, it looks like a standard error page. If you want to modernize this HTML, we could consider:

1. Using HTML5 semantic elements
2. Improving accessibility
3. Using modern CSS practices (like flexbox or grid for layout)
4. Adding responsive design for better mobile support

Let me know if you'd like me to provide suggestions for modernizing this HTML file, or if you have a different C# file you'd like me to review.
