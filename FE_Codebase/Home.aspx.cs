I apologize, but the code you've provided is not C#/.NET code. It's an HTML file, possibly an error page for GitHub. There's no C# code to modernize or refactor in this case.

If you have a specific C#/.NET file that you'd like modernized, please provide that code instead, and I'd be happy to help you with refactoring and modernization.

For the HTML file you've shared, it appears to be a standard GitHub error page for restricted access. If you're looking to modify or improve this page, you would need to work within GitHub's system, as this is likely a standard template they use for such errors.

If you have any C# code you'd like reviewed or modernized, please share that, and I'll be glad to assist you.
