I apologize, but the code you've provided is not C#/.NET code. It appears to be an HTML file, possibly an error page for GitHub. There's no C# code to modernize or refactor in this context.

If you have a specific C# file that you'd like modernized, please provide that code instead. I'd be happy to help with refactoring C# code, updating libraries, optimizing performance, and ensuring security best practices.

For the HTML provided, if you're looking to modernize it, here are a few suggestions:

1. Use HTML5 semantic tags where appropriate (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
2. Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap for responsive design.
3. Use more accessible color contrasts.
4. Implement proper meta tags for SEO and social media sharing.
5. Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SASS for more maintainable styles.

If you have any specific C# code you'd like to modernize, please share it and I'll be glad to assist you.
