I apologize, but the code you've provided is not C#/.NET code from a file named "Login.aspx.designer.cs". Instead, it appears to be an HTML file for a GitHub error page. 

For C#/.NET code modernization, I would typically suggest:

1. Using the latest C# language features
2. Updating to the latest .NET framework version
3. Using async/await for asynchronous operations
4. Implementing dependency injection
5. Using modern logging frameworks
6. Applying SOLID principles
7. Using newer security practices

However, since the provided code is HTML, these suggestions don't apply. If you have a C#/.NET file that you'd like modernized, please provide that code instead, and I'd be happy to help with specific modernization suggestions.

For the HTML file you've shared, here are a few modern web development suggestions:

1. Use HTML5 semantic tags where appropriate (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
2. Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS for more maintainable styles
3. Use modern CSS features like Flexbox or Grid for layout
4. Implement responsive design using CSS media queries
5. Consider using a modern JavaScript framework for more complex interactivity
6. Ensure the page is accessible by adding appropriate ARIA attributes
7. Use modern meta tags for better SEO and social media sharing

If you have any specific C#/.NET code you'd like modernized, please share it and I'll be glad to help.
